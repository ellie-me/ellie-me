## About Me
_"Code is poetry, and poetry has no boundaries."_

🎹 Piano Player | 🌈 Transgender | 🥋 Wushu Enthusiast | 🎮 Gamer | 🤘 Goth | 🎵 Music Addict | 🚀 Entrepreneur | 🧠 Neurodivergent | 📚 Hobbyist Philosopher

I waltz through the intricacies of severe hyperactive **ADHD** and my melodic aversion to certain sounds (a.k.a. mysophonia). The former occasionally choreographs a delayed processing speed, a quirky feature beyond my control. So, when the technical assessment spotlight shines, I humbly ask for your understanding and a tad more time. Your virtuoso patience is sincerely cherished. 🎶✨
